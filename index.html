  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1> 
  <p1>
    My coursework at SNHU has been instrumental in shaping the skills essential for my career in computer science. Each course provided a unique opportunity to engage in hands-on projects, often guided by stakeholder input, which closely mimicked real-world scenarios. This experience has not only enhanced my technical abilities but also sharpened my understanding of the collaborative and communicative aspects of software development. One of the most valuable lessons Iâ€™ve learned is the importance of teamwork and effective communication. Whether collaborating with classmates on complex problems in reverse software engineering (CS410) or discussing solutions in online forums, I developed the ability to work effectively within a team environment. These interactions honed my problem-solving skills and taught me how to articulate technical concepts clearly, both to peers and stakeholders. In terms of technical proficiency, I gained a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms through courses like CS350, where I created a machine learning simulation that solved a maze puzzle. This project, in particular, allowed me to apply advanced algorithms to practical problems, reinforcing my ability to think critically and solve complex challenges. My experience with software engineering and databases was equally comprehensive. From building databases with MySQL and MongoDB to connecting them to Python programs for full-stack applications, I developed a robust foundation in both backend and frontend development. Courses such as CS465 (Full Stack Development) provided me with the skills to create efficient, secure, and user-friendly web applications, bridging the gap between data management and user experience. Security was a recurring theme throughout my coursework, and I was able to deepen my knowledge through classes like CS305 (Software Security) and CS405 (Secure Coding). I learned the importance of secure coding practices, including cryptography and the avoidance of hard-coded credentials. These courses equipped me with the tools to write code that is not only functional but also resilient against potential security threats. Overall, my SNHU coursework has thoroughly prepared me for a successful career in software engineering. The combination of technical skills, teamwork, stakeholder communication, and a strong emphasis on security has given me the confidence to tackle real-world challenges and continue learning in an ever-evolving field.

<h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    This portfolio displays my abilities in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I chose three artifacts from three courses I took over the course of my degree and enhanced them to further display my skills in these categories. The first artifact is from CS350 (Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies), and is the final project that was completed. I took this project and enhanced it to display my abilities in software design and engineering by expanding on the softwares functionality and increasing its practicality. The second artifact is from CS330 (Computational Graphics and Visualization). I enhanced this artifact by including more complicated and better utilized data structures and algorithms to solidify the overall project code. The third and final artifact is from CS340 (Advanced Programming Concepts). I enhanced this final artifact by creating a MongoDB interface with a React website to prove my abilities with databases. Before I had written any enhancements for the artifacts I created an informal code review that went over the code for each artifact, and highlighted their strengths and weaknesses that I would address.
