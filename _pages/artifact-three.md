### Narrative for Artifact Three
This artifact is a website that displays data from a dog shelter along with a pie chart and a geolocation map with pins. It runs off of a python file to deal with CRUD operations connected to a mongoDB database, along with a jupyter file that runs the frontend website. This item displays an ability to develop not only the front end of a website but also handle the backend with a secure database. This displays my specific abilities of full stack development of websites which is something I want to go into. I improved the artifact by moving it into a more used React website with javascript. I did meet almost all the objectives, however I was unable to transfer the original database as it was in the virtual desktop for the class. Instead, I created a new database in mongoDB Atlas and added two dogs just to make sure everything was working. I was successful in upgrading this website as React is still very popular in the modern coding world and is something I want to continue to work with. I was able to build a more collaborative environment by making the website into a more frequently used language, as well as being able to use well-founded full stack programming techniques, and skills. This was a difficult enhancement and the website still has a few issues in terms of stability. There are some errors that occasionally come up, but after a cache reload would go away. This would be an issue if the website were real, so I would want to further enhance that. I also had trouble at one point getting my database on mongoDB Atlas to connect with my local host website and had to install a new dependency to get them to work together. I made sure to use helpful software like Postman to make sure that my database was set up correctly when I had issues loading data on the site. Overall, I learned a lot from this enhancement and am proud of the work I have done.
